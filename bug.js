The Firebase SDK may throw an error if you try to access a property of a document snapshot before the snapshot has been fully populated.  This often happens when you're using asynchronous operations and trying to read data before the `onSnapshot` listener has returned.  The error message might not be immediately clear, potentially appearing as an undefined property or a similar generic error.
